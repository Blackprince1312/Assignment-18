### Intro to Backbone

Backbone is the first MVC framework you will use.

### Learning Objectives

- Have a basic understanding of how to use a REST API
- Show an understanding of, Backbone Models and Collections
- Understanding of how to use a BaaS (backend as a service)

## Normal Mode

1. [Sign up for Parse](https://www.parse.com/signup)
2. Create a new parse app
3. Add at least 1 class to your parse app
4. Manually add some data
5. Create a new app that uses Backbone models and collections to fetch the data from parse and put it on the screen

__Note:__ as long as data is being fetching from parse via Backbone and displayed an the screen then you are free to do whatever else.

Have fun with the data and go all out or just make it as simple as you want.

__Hint:__
Work on getting the data on the screen before styling anything.
